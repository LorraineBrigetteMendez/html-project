 <h1>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear</h1>
 <p>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889, is one of the artist's most poignant and revealing works. The portrait was created shortly after van Gogh famously severed part of his left ear during a mental breakdown while living in Arles, France. This incident marked one of the most turbulent periods in van Gogh's life, when he struggled with mental illness and emotional instability, yet continued to paint with intense dedication.

    In this self-portrait, van Gogh depicts himself in three-quarter view, wearing a green coat, a fur-lined hat, and a bandage covering his wounded ear. His expression is introspective and serious, perhaps reflective of the inner pain he was experiencing. Behind him, a Japanese print and an easel are visible, both nods to his admiration for Japanese art and his deep commitment to painting, even in his most troubled times.
            
    The use of bold colors and expressive brushstrokes in Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear are typical of van Gogh’s style, with intense contrasts between the cool blue tones of his coat and the warm, earthy colors of the background. The thick, directional brushstrokes create a sense of texture and movement, while the muted yet intense color palette mirrors his complex emotional state. The painting is an intimate, unflinching look at van Gogh’s suffering and resilience, capturing his vulnerability as well as his determination to continue his art.
            
   Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear is held in the Courtauld Gallery in London and remains one of the most famous representations of van Gogh's life and struggles. It has come to symbolize the connection between creativity and personal suffering, with van Gogh’s image and story resonating deeply with audiences who see him as a figure of both genius and tragedy.</p>
