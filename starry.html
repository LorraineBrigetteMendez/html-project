    <h1>Starry Night Over the Rhône</h1>
    <p> Starry Night Over the Rhône, painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1888, is another stunning nightscape that showcases van Gogh's fascination with the beauty and mystery of the night sky.
        <br>
        Created during his time in Arles, France, this work captures the view of the Rhône River under a starry sky, with reflections of the stars shimmering on the water's surface. The painting’s scene is illuminated by gas lamps along the riverbank, casting a warm glow over the blue and green tones of the water.

        Unlike the more abstract and swirling sky in his later The Starry Night (1889), Starry Night Over the Rhône is more tranquil and grounded in reality. The composition shows a couple walking along the banks, adding a romantic touch and human presence to the landscape. The stars and city lights reflected on the river create a sense of depth and sparkle, evoking a mood of quiet intimacy and connection with nature.
        
        Van Gogh used his characteristic bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, blending yellows with deep blues, to convey the interplay of light and dark. This painting is often seen as a study in contrast—between light and dark, warmth and coolness, and the vastness of the night sky with the intimacy of the scene below.
        
        Starry Night Over the Rhône is now part of the collection at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. It remains one of van Gogh's iconic works, reflecting his deep fascination with the night and his ability to capture its beauty in a way that resonates with viewers even today.</p>
